I am having trouble with Learning Pathways.  Getting this error message:  
Microsoft 365 learning pathways has a configuration issue. Ask your administrator for assistance. [Administrators: Please see the browser console for detailed logs. For technical assistance check out the issues list at https://github.com/pnp/custom-learning-office-365/issues.]
and so I am here looking for a solution.
